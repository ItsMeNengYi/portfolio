                    This was my first Arduino project, where I created a system to control track skipping and volume settings using hand movements. The idea came to me while experimenting with a sensor I had, which could detect the distance between itself and an object. I quickly realized that this sensor had numerous potential applications, one of which led to this project. Iâ€™m pleased that the C++ programming skills I gained while learning Unreal Engine proved useful here.

                        This ultrasonic sensor can determind the distance of the object in front of it by emmiting an ultrasonic wave which will be reflected by the object and received by the sensor. With the approx speed of sound in air(speed of air molecule) and the time taken for the wave to echo back, I can calculate the distance and speed of the object moving.I used the calculated speed to determine if the object(hand) movement.

                        I use pyserial to access paired devices(HC-05) and establish serial communication(connect to HC-05), both computer will send character with utf-8 encode. The name of current track is send one char by one char, so it will send an initiator "[" which indicate the start of song name and "]" indicate the end of the name.
