                        First of all, I add a rotating feature which player will always face in the cursor direction. I implement this feature using some math as shown in the Pic1. Xc represent x-axis value of cursor while Xp represent player. As the origin of xy coordinates system in pygame is at top left and y value increase downward which is different from what Ive learnt in school. Instead of convert the coordinate system to the one I familiar with(I shouldve done that), I come up with my simple approach. Get the reference angle from the absolute value of the difference of x and y value of cursor and player. Check the direction of the cursor relative to player and determind to either add or abstract 90deg. I remember getting absurd spinning animation and multiple crash when implementing this feature such as rotating at opposite direction.

                        I then need to determind which direction will the bullet propagate as in the youtube tutorial the player cant be rotated. I implement this feature using similar math approach. Find the increments of x and y direction and form a vector of magnitude of self.speed which is one of the properties of Bullet class. At first I implement using tangent value as seen in the video below, I didnt figure out why the bullet speed is not consistent but I leave it first as the direction of propagation is okay, afterwards I found out that the tangential value is affecting the bullet speed.
                            Other than direction of bullet, I also implemented a buffed version of shooting bullet which the bullet will be shot from three point as shown in first video.

            rel="noopener noreferrer">github link</a>, The Animation, Sound and img file need to be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the pygameTest.exe file for the file to be executable.
